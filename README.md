# jquery-scroll-point-navigator
A small(ish) jQuery plugin that detects defined scroll points on a page and navigates between them.

## Requirements

* jQuery (duh)
* Dirk Groenen's awesome [jQuery-viewport-checker](https://github.com/dirkgroenen/jQuery-viewport-checker)

Just `cd` into the plugin directory and run `bower install`
