          Excuse me. That's for messing up my hair. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Lorenzo, where're you keys? Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, Biff. No, not yet. You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks. Wow, you must be rich.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can't play. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. That's George McFly. Doc. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? C'mon. Well, I figured, what the hell. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.
